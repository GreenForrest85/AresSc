Alpha 3
- find a way to build when the screen was moved
- build script: rebuild comman center, third supply depot
- Reading some variable out of a config file, so I can change values in runtime.
- use open ai baselines: PPO2
- check issue: switched coordinates
- parallel envs

Alpha 2

Problem: Its hard to put all the action space in one level. Right now its like this: 0-3 are simple tasks like to build a 
supply depot, then there is 4 to 67 for attacking different areas of the map. That does not seem very natural and in fact 
it does not to work very well. 4 to 67 have all the same meaning, which is to attack, but it takes more than 90% of the action 
space. Attack should be just one option and then another neural net makes the decision where to attack.

Target: For this version I will first script a simple program that gives all the orders for building. Then there 
will be a second logic, a neural net, taking care of where to attack. Every logic will have half of the steps.
